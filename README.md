My Capstone Portfolio website

This is the final project in the Treehouse Front end Web Development Techdegree. In this project I used the following technologies: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. In this project is a portfolio of most of the projects I have completed during the FEWD techdgree. I also created a Contact Form and the form works when hosted through Netlify on my portfolio website: bertwitzel.com
